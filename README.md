# Strapi Starter Next 14, Tailwind, Typescript and Strapi

## Getting Started

If you prefer videos that guide you through the setup process you can find them [here](https://github.com/strapi/nextjs-corporate-starter/issues/71)

1. Run `setup` command to setup frontend and backend dependencies:

```bash
  yarn setup
```

2. Next, navigate to your `/backend` directory and set up your `.env` file. You can use the `.env.example` file as reference:

```bash
HOST=localhost
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS="toBeModified1,toBeModified2"
API_TOKEN_SALT=tobemodified
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=tobemodified
JWT_SECRET=tobemodified
TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT=tobemodified
```

3. Start backend the following command:

```bash
  yarn backend
```

You will be prompted to create your first admin user.

Great. You now have your project running. Let's add some data.

## Seeding The Data

```bash
  yarn seed
```

## Setting Up The Frontend

Next we need to switch to our `/frontend` directory and create our `.env` file and paste in the following.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAGE_LIMIT=6
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_FORM_SUBMISSION_TOKEN=your-form-submission-token
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL=http://localhost:1337

```

Inside your Strapi Admin Panel navigate to Settings -> API Tokens and click on the `Create new API Token`.

Here are our Token Settings

Name: Public API Token Content
Description: Access to public content.
Token duration: Unlimited
Token type: Custom

In Permissions lets give the following access.

| Content         |   Permissions    |
| --------------- | :--------------: |
| Article         | find and findOne |
| Author          | find and findOne |
| Category        | find and findOne |
| Global          |       find       |
| Page            | find and findOne |
| Product-feature | find and findOne |

![permissions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6153188/231865625-a3634d89-0f40-4a6d-a356-8f654abd88b9.gif)

Once you have your token add it to your `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_TOKEN` variable name in the `.env` file.

**Alternatively:** you can create a READ only Token that will give READ permission to all your endpoints.

Next create a token that will allow us to submit our form.

Name: Public API Form Submit
Description: Form Submission.
Token duration: Unlimited
Token type: Custom

In Permissions lets give the following access.

| Content              | Permissions |
| -------------------- | :---------: |
| Lead-Form-Submission |   create    |

Add your token to your `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_FORM_SUBMISSION_TOKEN` variable name in the `.env` file.

Once your environment variables are set you can start your frontend application by running `yarn dev`.

## Start Both Projects Concurrently

You can start both apps by running `yarn dev`.
